        <h3>Cities I have lived in:</h3>
        <p>I grew up in Lorain, OH as a child. When I was 7 years old my family
            moved to Amherst, OH. After that I went to live with my dad in Vermilion, OH
            when I was 13 years old. I stayed in Vermilion until I graduated highschool.
            I then moved to Bowling Green for college. After graduating from college
            the military stationed me in Los Angeles where I currently live.

        <h4>Cities I would like to visit:</h4>
        <p>I got to visit Rome in highschool on a school trip. It was amazing to see and
            I would love to take my wife to visit and show her the rest of Italy as well.
            I've never been to Honolulu but living in LA it is not too far and will be the
            best opportunity for me to go visit. Tokyo has always peaked my interest and I
            would like to go and see the different culture.
